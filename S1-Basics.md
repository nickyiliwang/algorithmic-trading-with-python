The Exchange Rate is the price for which foreign currencies are traded. The Quote List and Quote Panel show different views of the current OANDA exchange (buy/sell) rates in real time. When there is movement in the exchange rate for a currency pair, the green and red up/down indicators alert traders to momentary changes in direction.

### CURRENCY PAIRS
Currency pairs are always listed in the same order. For example, the most commonly-traded currency pair consists of the Euro and the U.S. dollar. This pair is always listed as EUR/USD and never the reverse order. In this example EUR is is the BASE currency, and USD is the QUOTE currency. When published with an exchange rate, the currency pair indicates how much of the quote currency is required to purchase one unit of the base currency.

### SPREAD
The SPREAD is the difference between the two prices. The bid price is always less than the ask price because brokers pay less than they receive for the same currency pair. This difference – known as the spread – is how your broker is compensated for their services in executing your trade. Some brokers, including OANDA, also offer pricing options that include a commission combined with lower spreads. A spread is commonly measured in pips. The pip is the value of the 4th decimal place for pairs other than for JPY, where it is 2nd decimal place. OANDA, however, offers increased pricing transparency by displaying 5 decimal places for currency pairs, other than JPY in which 3 decimal places are shown. This is called a pipette.

### BID PRICE
The BID price is the rate that your broker is willing to pay for the currency pair; in other words, this is the rate you receive if selling to the market. For example in the rate panel shown, the bid price is 1.05761. You could sell one Euro for 1.05761 US dollars.

### ASK PRICE
The ASK price is the rate at which your broker is willing to sell and represents the rate you must pay to buy the base currency. In the example 1 Euro will cost you 1.05775 US dollars.
